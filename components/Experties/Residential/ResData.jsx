      "The one-way road network around the site meant that it was vital to minimise disruption to the road; all contractor parking was located in local car parks surrounding the site, and road closures were limited to the dates of the installation and removal of the crane. The Nest Boutique Hotel is part of the larger Naivasha Hotelier. This project consists of 2 residential blocks, making up 49 apartments, surrounding a central landscaped podium courtyard. Below the apartments situates a commercial unit, a car park and cycle storage.This project was logistically challenging as the development is adjacent to the Naivasha Road.The compound space was not available and working space to the boundaries was minimal. Co-ordination of logistics, delivery movements and site personnel were paramount so as not toimpact on our neighbours",
